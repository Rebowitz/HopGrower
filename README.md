# HopGrower
App created by HopsFromVirginia.com for hopgrowers everywhere!

The application is intended to educate and help hop farmers, whether they be hobbyists or serious growers to manage annual growing cycles of these marvelous plants.

This app was recently migrated from EclipseADT to Android Studio(intelliJ).  The Studio GUI was used to upload the code, so there may be some things that need adjusting.  For instance, the Documentation did not get uploaded, nor did the .APK file.  As I work out the methods necessary, changes will be coming.
